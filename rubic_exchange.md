##Project Overview

Rubic is a ‘one-click’ Cross-Chain Protocol and tools to enable it for apps. Users of ours can trade over 15,500+ tokens, on and between 20 networks, through the aggregation of over 70+ DEXs, different bridges cross-chain providers.

###Overview
Name: Rubic Exchange
Brief Description: Rubic`s audience can perform swap on and between various networks supported by cross chain protocol. Rubic provides its protocol as SDK and widget. Projects can get cross chain interoparability and interconnection with other blockchains, attract more new audience and liquidity from other blockchains; project of any size can become cross chain operable with fast speed of transaction, totally secured and low fees. Our revenue is to be generated via partnerships and be split between Rubic and integrators. Users utilize Rubic for trade at one place instead of going into another services to perform trade.
Relationship to EOSIO: EOS is ont of the leading networks with great community and huge potential
Reason for interest: With an industry-wide lack of blockchain interoperability, crypto projects built on different networks can’t offer users the advantages of several blockchains simultaneously, nor can they easily reach those users. We strive to give users access to any network, EOS in this regard is more than just eligible to give audience an opportunity to use the cross chain with lowest fees, intuitive UI and best rates. Integrators of our tools will be able to receive best solution on the market as SDK and widget and sharing business model of ours as well.
