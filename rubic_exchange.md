## Project Overview

Rubic is a ‘one-click’ Cross-Chain Protocol and tools to enable it for apps. Users of ours can trade over 17,500+ tokens, on and between 20 networks, through the aggregation of over 70+ DEXs, different bridges cross-chain providers.

### Overview

- **Name:** Rubic Exchange
- **Brief Description:** Rubic`s audience can perform swap on and between various networks supported by cross chain protocol. - Rubic provides its protocol as SDK and widget. Projects can get cross chain interoparability and interconnection with other blockchains, attract more new audience and liquidity from other blockchains; project of any size can become cross chain operable with fast speed of transaction, totally secured and low fees. Our revenue is to be generated via partnerships and be split between Rubic and integrators. Users utilize Rubic for trade at one place instead of going into another services to perform trade.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** EOS is ont of the leading networks with great community and huge potential
Reason for interest: With an industry-wide lack of blockchain interoperability, crypto projects built on different networks can’t offer users the advantages of several blockchains simultaneously, nor can they easily reach those users. We strive to give users access to any network, EOS in this regard is more than just eligible to give audience an opportunity to use the cross chain with lowest fees, intuitive UI and best rates. Integrators of our tools will be able to receive best solution on the market as SDK and widget and sharing business model of ours as well.

### Project Details 

Rubic is not only a One-click Cross-Chain app but also a set of tools to enable cross-chain for projects so that one can trade any of 17,500+ tokens on and between 20 networks directly on your platform. 

- **A. Cross Chain Swaps:** Rubic's protocol offers easy trading for more than 17,500+ assets across networks, using our custom and unique Cross-Chain Protocol. Utilizing liquidity pools and our own smart contracts, Rubic provides an extremely easy-to-use Cross-Chain solution to all traders. Cross-Chain swaps are available between 20 networks right now: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis Chain, Celo, Fuse, Cronos, Moonbeam, OKC chain, Telos, Boba Network, Bitcoin, Aurora, Moonriver, TRON, Bitgert (much more networks are coming)
- **B. On Chain Swaps:** Since Rubic aggregates DEXs, users can execute On-Chain Swaps on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Fuse, Celo, Optimism, Moonbeam, OKC, Boba, Moonriver, Cronos, TRON, Harmony, Bitgert and ETH POW networks. By utilizing external DEXs, users are ensured the best possible rates.
- **C. Security:** Being an aggregator, Rubic ensures security via automated monitoring and switches off transactions to a corrupted service immediately. Rubic’s Cross-Chain Protocol was sucessfully audited. Rubic has 24/7 Live Support on Telegram, Discord, and built-in on the website. In addition, we have a convenient auto-refund policy. In the case of specific transaction failures, Rubic’s team will complete your refund in the form of USDC tokens in 24 hours. 
- **D. Rubic's tools for prokects:** We provide our multichain protocol as free SDK for B2B customers. So, integrator gets in the end fully working backend with 70+ integrated DEXs and 20 blockchains. Since it is white-label solution your team only needs to build frontend, backend is on our shoulders. The SDK integration itself is free and offers even more advantages, one of which is our business revenue model. We have the widget with full functionality of Rubic itself, it can be integrated in a matter of minutes and integrator get its rewards as well. 
- **E. Referral Program:** The Rubic Referral Program allows users to earn on fees from swaps through widgets, as well as receive fixed rewards for each successful widget integration on the websites of referred projects.

### Ecosystem Fit 
- This project fits under the core codebase of EOSIO.
- We aim at EOS audience, audience of already supported networks, other projects developing on EOS and those which use our tools (more than 80).
- The project gives cross chain operability and interconnection to other networks included into project's protocol.
- Cross chain on EOS is developed by pNetwork, its service seems to be similar with Rubic but outdated in some sense.
- However, pNetwork supports less chains than our project does and it has no SDK/widget for expanding cross chain oparability into other projects, we share our income with integratoes as well. Tools of the project fit for wallets, DApps as Games, Launchpads, Metaverses, DEXs, NFT marketplaces, trading platforms, P2E games, educational platforms, crypto news aggregators. Our advantage is also in fast speed of transaction, totally secured trade and low fees. Regular updates by our dev team improves the platform.

### Development Status
Project is alive since September 2020. During that time team improved the project and it became one of the leading in cross chain area. Average audience - DAU-1,5-2k, WAU- 12-15k, MAU- 35-45k. We are growing always, have more than 80 partners, 24hr volume - 300k$. Audience of ours is on each chain that our protocol supports, projects of differrent size utilize tools of ours.

Rubic's team released its widget and SDK long time ago. From that time a lot of projects gained a lot by using easy swap and omnichain solution. 

**Examples of SDK integration:** 
- https://hector.network/ecosystem-dex/ 
- https://swap.kuma-inu.com/
- https://alpha-sokuswap.vercel.app/

As a white-label solution, Rubic’s SDK can be easily integrated into any environment by letting any team to write its own logic in the code on how users will go through each step when making a swap. Also, Rubic’s SDK gives integrators full control over the UI on your platform. Business revenue model is one of our advantages over competitors.
